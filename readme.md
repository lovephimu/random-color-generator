# Random Color Generator

This code will generate random and specific colors based on the user input! Additionally the color will be presented in a fun 31x9 # character block with its hex code in the center.

Hex color code generation and translation of words into hex code are based on the randomcolor npm package.

Colors in the terminal are shown using ANSI syntax.

## How to use

There are two ways of using this code:
_The random way_

```bash
$ node index.js
```

just start the code using this basic node command

_The word-y way_

```bash
$ node index.js blue(or some other hue) dark(or some other luminosity)
```
